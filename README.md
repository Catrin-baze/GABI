This repository contains the official implementation for the paper:  
**Vision-Language-Guided Granularity Alignment and Balanced Fusion for Multimodal Brain Data**

## 1. Prerequisites

Before running GABI, please ensure you have the necessary data and a properly configured environment.

### 1.1 Data Acquisition

GABI is trained and evaluated on publicly available medical datasets.  
You will need to obtain access to the following datasets:

- **ADNI** (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)  
  [https://adni.loni.usc.edu/](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)

- **OASIS-1** (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies)
